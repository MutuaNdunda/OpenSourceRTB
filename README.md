### Land Preparation:
The recommendation engine takes into account various factors, such as soil type, topography, and local conditions, to guide farmers in selecting the most suitable land preparation method. It provides recommendations on whether to opt for traditional tilling or ridge cultivation techniques, allowing farmers to optimize their cassava yields based on their specific farming contexts.

### Planting and Harvesting Timings:
To achieve optimal yields and maximize profit, it is crucial to make informed decisions regarding planting and harvesting timings. The recommendation engine leverages data from local weather patterns, growth stages of cassava, and market demands. By analyzing this information, it offers precise recommendations on when to plant and harvest cassava crops. This ensures that the cassava roots reach maturity without being too young or overripe, resulting in higher-quality yields.

### Fertilizer Application:
Applying the appropriate types and quantities of fertilizers is essential for promoting healthy cassava growth and maximizing productivity. The recommendation engine takes into account soil nutrient levels, crop nutrient requirements, and farmers' input regarding available resources and budget. Based on this information, it provides personalized recommendations on the specific types and quantities of fertilizers that farmers should apply at different stages of the cassava growth cycle.

### Intercropping Strategies:
Intercropping, the practice of cultivating multiple crops within the same field, offers numerous benefits in cassava production. The RTB Recommendation Engine assists farmers in identifying suitable companion crops for intercropping with cassava, with a focus on maize in Nigeria and sweet potato in Tanzania. By considering factors such as crop compatibility, resource utilization, and market demand, the engine suggests optimal intercropping strategies that enhance soil health, maximize land productivity, and diversify income streams for farmers.

## Repository Structure
**/OriginalRPackage** The purpose of this folder is to maintain the integrity of the original R code files, preserving their initial state and version. It allows for easy reference and comparison with subsequent code modifications or updates.

**/RTBEngine**  Contains the code for a Flask application that has been developed by converting an existing R package. This Flask app serves as an alternative implementation of the RTB Recommendation Engine, providing the same functionality and features as the original R package but in a web-based format.
